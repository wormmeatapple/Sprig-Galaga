Sprig is a Hack Club project that incentives high schoolers to persue game dev.

I am recreating my own simpified version of Galaga.

W A S D to move and I to shoot.

Fight against waves of alien ships as they get progressively faster and more in number.

Brag about your score to friends, foes and cyborgs!
